# What is Wisp?

Wisp doesn't stand for anything, but if it did it might be a recursive accronym
for "Wisp is special purpose" or "Wisp, instant static pages".

Wisp is a ultra fast static site oriented HTTP server based on the httpbeast
library in Nim. It can serve static sites, really fast, and have some other
tricks that allows it to add dynamic behaviour to static sites.

It is not a general purpose web server, it is not a web framework, it is not
suposed to be facing the internet...

BUT! If you have a static site, or a hundred, and want to serve them as fast as
you possibly can, Wisp is for you.

As we said, special purpose and instant static pages, Wisp!
